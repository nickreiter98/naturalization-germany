# Welcome to my Data Visualisation Project: Naturalization to Germany

## 🌟 Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository!
In this project, my goal is to discover insights and patterns within complex datasets. By converting raw data into clear visual stories, I strive to make information easily accessible and understandable to all.

## 📊 About the Data 
As underlying data, I use a rich dataset obtained from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany's [GENESIS](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online) online database. Specifically, I am using the data set conataining various infomations of the naturalization to Germany. You can find this dataset [here](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=12511-0014&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1710171917348#abreadcrumb). Literally, Genesis is a goldmine for anyone keen on understanding the intricate details and social trends of various governmental domains in Germany.
